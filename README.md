## Market Research Team 
As part of a Market Research Team I want to test the potential customer interest. I need to see where the interest lies so we can have the information we need to enable efficient manufacturing.

## Developer
As a developer I want to create I want to use object oriented programming to build this site, so that the site will be more effective and the code will be easier to read and understand. I want to be able to create a three item random selection and track the clicks and tally them for a final analysis of the data. They will be able to do this a maximum of 25 times.

## Focus Group participant
As a participant of a focus group I will need to be able to select the random item and be able to look at the picture and make a selection purely on the descriptive image.
